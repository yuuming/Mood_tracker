## Introduction

- This is a small project written in React Native.
- We're inspired by a mood tracker on paper from Pinterest and made a decision to make it happen on mobile devices.
- 'Mood & Colors' is our concept, stem from our belief that colors represent and affect our many diffrenet kinds of emotions.

Users can track their mood of the day with beautiful colour themes, write a diary, post pictures and put tags to keep their private memories. Our goal is making users mood better through this app. 
ex) When user select the sad mood colour, this app shows a little cute devil which represents users sadness, and let them to tap it to make user to feel that negative feeling goes away. (WIP parts)  



## What we're using...
