## Introduction

- This is a small project written in React Native for both iOS and Android ( currntly only avairable for Android).

Users can track their mood of the day with beautiful colour themes, write a diary, post pictures and put tags to keep their private memories. Our goal is making users mood better through this app. 
ex) When user select the sad mood colour, this app shows a little cute devil which represents users sadness, and let them to tap it to make user to feel that negative feeling goes away. (WIP parts)
